# ðŸ“‘ Project Report â€“ Healthcare Chatbot

## 1. Title

**Healthcare Chatbot for Disease Prediction and Precautions**

---

## 2. Abstract

This project aims to develop an AI-based healthcare chatbot that can predict possible diseases based on user-given symptoms. The chatbot uses a medical dataset that contains diseases, their related symptoms, severity levels, descriptions, and precautionary measures. The system provides an interactive interface similar to WhatsApp/Instagram chat, making it user-friendly.

The chatbot is built using **Python (Flask backend)** and **HTML/CSS/JS frontend** for the user interface. It preprocesses symptoms, normalizes input, and matches them with dataset entries to provide relevant disease predictions along with descriptions and suggested precautions.

---

## 3. Objectives

* To provide a simple AI-based chatbot for initial medical assistance.
* To predict diseases based on user symptoms.
* To provide descriptions and precautionary measures for predicted diseases.
* To design an attractive chat-based interface for user interaction.
* To reduce the initial burden on healthcare professionals by providing quick guidance.

---

## 4. Problem Statement

Many people ignore early-stage symptoms due to lack of awareness, which may lead to severe health issues later. Visiting a doctor for every minor symptom is not always feasible. Hence, there is a need for a system that can guide users about possible diseases and preventive measures based on their symptoms.

---

## 5. Dataset Description

We used the **Disease Symptom Prediction Dataset** from Kaggle. The dataset contains:

* **dataset.csv** â†’ Diseases and their related symptoms.
* **symptom\_Description.csv** â†’ Descriptions of each disease.
* **symptom\_precaution.csv** â†’ Precautionary measures for each disease.
* **Symptom-severity.csv** â†’ Severity score for each symptom.

---

## 6. Methodology

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

* Cleaned null/NaN values.
* Normalized symptom names (e.g., `"Skin Rash"` â†’ `skin_rash`).

### Step 2: Backend Development

* Implemented using **Flask (Python)**.
* Developed a function `predict_disease()` to match user input with dataset symptoms.
* Retrieved disease, description, and precautions.

### Step 3: Frontend Development

* Designed chatbot UI using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
* Added features:

  * Attractive interface with healthcare-themed background.
  * Scrollable chat history.
  * Send message by **Enter key** or **Send button**.
  * Initial greeting message from chatbot.

## 7. System Architecture

**User** â†’ Inputs symptoms â†’ **Chatbot UI** â†’ Sends request â†’ **Flask Backend** â†’ Searches dataset â†’ Returns predicted disease + description + precautions â†’ **User sees result in chat interface**

---

## 8. Features

âœ… User-friendly chat-based interface
âœ… Symptom normalization for accurate matching
âœ… Disease prediction with description
âœ… Suggests preventive measures
âœ… Attractive UI with healthcare theme

---

## 9. Tools & Technologies

* **Python (Flask)** â€“ Backend
* **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ Data preprocessing
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** â€“ Frontend interface
* **Dataset** â€“ Kaggle (Disease Symptom Prediction)

---

## 10. Results

* Successfully predicted diseases based on symptoms like *fever, headache, cough, skin rash, etc.*
* Provided relevant disease descriptions and precautions.
* Interactive UI similar to WhatsApp/Instagram chat.

---

## 11. Limitations

* Predictions are based only on the dataset.
* Cannot replace professional medical diagnosis.
* Works only for diseases present in the dataset.

---

## 12. Future Work

* Add voice-based input for symptoms.
* Integrate with real-time hospital/doctor databases.
* Improve accuracy with Machine Learning models.
* Add multilingual support.
* Mobile app development.

---

## 13. Conclusion

The Healthcare Chatbot is a useful tool for preliminary medical guidance. By taking symptoms as input, it predicts possible diseases, provides a brief description, and suggests preventive measures. Though it does not replace doctors, it can help users become more aware of their health conditions and take timely precautions.
